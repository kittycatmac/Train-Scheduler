# Train-Scheduler

This app uses Firebase to host arrival, departure data, and adding trains to the schedule. Moment.js is used to calculate the minutes away.

# To Get Started

Enter the name of the train, destination, how frequent it runs, first train of the day then hit submit. Keep adding trains to know how many minutes the train is away. Hit the remove buttons to remove specific trains.

Built with: 
JQuery
Moment.js 
Firebase
Bootstrap

# Deployment 

If deployed on a live system a large database would be needed. And an API to live train data would increase the need to re-write the Javascript.
